# F1 Remixed
Running through all the possible season of the F1 2019 season to find out what could have been. Inspired by Chainbear's 2019 Remixed video on Youtube.

We take a look at every possible combination of races and see who wins the championship in each season.

You can sort the results by total championships in all season lengths; by different season lengths; or by driver and season lengths.
For example, sort by Sergio Perez's 1 race winning season to see that if the season consisted only on the Sahkir GP, Sergio Perez would be the 2020 champion. Or, look at the breakdown by season length for 2020 and see that any combination of 10 races would result in a Lewis Hamilton title.

Note: In the case of a tie in the standings, the program will randomly select a champion. Additionally, the tiebreaking process only factors in top 10 finishes.

Interesting Notes:
- In the 2019 season, only 5 drivers can be champions
- Despite winning only 1 race in 2019, sebastian Vettel can win a championship in a 9 race season while 2-time winner Charles Leclerc can only win in seasons up to 8 races.
- The hectic 2020 season saw 8 potential winners (up from 5 in 2019)
- In 2020, 5th and 7th-9th cannot win championships but 10th-12th can (Esteban Ocon, Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly). This shows how championships are not just a function of how well you perform, but of how your opposition performs in comparison to you.
